# Robustness
This toolbox is used to apply the Signal Temporal logic to industry scenario. It offers a tool for verification and parameters synthesisi of hybrid system. Miner is a python libarary providing a coherent set of model-based techniques aimed at the analysis of hyberid dynamical system. The primary feature of miner is to calculate the robustness for a given trajectories associated with a STL formulae. Based on the calculation of robustness, Miner opens a big windows for the combination of STL and machine learning. THe application domain of Miner ranges from system design, system verification/ validation, performance guarantee control, pattern recongition.
