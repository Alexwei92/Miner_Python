# Robustness
This toolbox is used to apply the [Signal Temporal Logic (STL)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30206-3_12 ) to industry scenario. It offers a tool for verification and parameters synthesis of hybrid system. `Miner_Python` is a Python library providing a coherent set of model-based techniques aimed at the analysis of hybrid dynamical system. 

The primary feature of miner is to calculate the **Robustness** for a set of given trajectories associated with an STL formula. Based on the calculation of robustness, `Miner_Python` opens a big windows for the combination of STL and machine learning. The application domain of `Miner_Python` ranges from System Design, System Verification/Validation, Performance Guarantee Control, Pattern Recognition.
