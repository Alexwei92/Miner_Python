# Robustness
This toolbox is used to apply the **Signal Temporal Logic(STL)** to industry scenario. It offers a tool for verification and parameters synthesis of hybrid system. `Miner` is a Python library providing a coherent set of model-based techniques aimed at the analysis of hybrid dynamical system. 

The primary feature of miner is to calculate the **Robustness** for a set of given trajectories associated with an STL formula. Based on the calculation of robustness, `Miner` opens a big windows for the combination of STL and machine learning. The application domain of `Miner` ranges from System Design, System Verification/Validation, Performance Guarantee Control, Pattern Recognition.
